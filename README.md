## Design

### Page Layout
 - The Expense Tracker app boasts a well-structured command-line interface, featuring clear user prompts, engaging ASCII art, and a logical menu structure, providing users with an intuitive and visually coherent platform for effective expense tracking and financial management.

 ### Color Scheme
- The app's color scheme enhances both its visual appeal and functionality by using consistent color-coding for different types of messages. This provides clear visual cues and improves the user experience.
 - Color BLUE - represents user input.
 - Color GREEN - represents success, invalid input or errors, guiding the user to provide the correct type of information.
 - Color RED - represents a warning message, and this helps to draw attention to a potential budget deficit. 
 - Color WHITE - represents default text color.
